Portfolio-Management-System
===========================

**Language:** C# (front-end)    &    MongoDB (back-end)                                                              
**Environment:** .NET framework

A portfolio Management system for tracking a user's stocks and investements has been developed using .NET framework in the front end and MongoDB on the backend. An interactive user interface was designed with options to track the performance of a particular stock including live graphs. NoSQL database MongoDB, the document based database system was used in the backend to manage large chuncks of data in real time with Map-Reduce. 

**Map-Reduce** programming model is implemented for processing large datasets parallely. Unlike SQL, NoSQL databases have an added advantage in efficiently handling large datasets which is helpful for large scale projects that are flexible to changes.This project even implements SQL server for managing datasets and makes a good performance comparison between **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases.


Modules:
--------
1. Create front-end UI for user interaction.
2. Create **SQL server** & **MongoDB** databases.
3. Extract and Populate data of current market stocks.
4. Create indexes for SQL server tables and MongoDB documents
5. Connect the front end UI with the Databases giving various options to manage data.
6. MongoDB with **Map-Reduce** model is implemented.
7. **Performance evaluation** between SQL server and MongoDB
